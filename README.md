A Computational Geometry library in Go

This library details a number of point location algorithms on Doubly-conncted edge lists (DCELs). In the process of implementing these, a general structure for implementing binary search trees and persistent search trees was also developed, a suite of operations on DCEL structures was developed, and a demo application to visualize said algorithms and manipulate DCELs was developed.

For a more detailed introduction to the package, see the docs/ folder.

For instructions on using the demo application, see the demo/ folder.
