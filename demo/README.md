# Point Location Demo

This folder holds code for an application which demos point location through
visualizaton of various algorithms.

This package cannot currently be go-gotten, as it has dependencies on a 
private repository. The bin folder holds pre-compiled binaries of this package,
however, in zip files named for the appropriate operating system of the compilation.

If you would like direct access to the private repository (a game engine called
oak) controlling the rendering and event handling for this project, contact
me at patrick.d.stephen@gmail.com
