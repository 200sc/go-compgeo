In each zip, there are four items:

  An executable to run, which starts the demo.

  A "oak.config" file, which provides configuraton settings to the engine.
  
  A "asssets" folder, which inside has a single font the engine uses to render with.
  
  And a "data" folder, which has a number of OFF files to load and test the program with.
